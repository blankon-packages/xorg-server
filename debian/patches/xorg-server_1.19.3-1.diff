+D-BUS Configuration API v2
+----------------------------
+
+The X server will register the bus name org.x.config.displayN, and the 
+object /org/x/config/N, where N is the display number.
+
+Currently only hotplugging of input devices is supported.
+
+org.x.config.input:
+    org.x.config.input.version:
+        Returns one unsigned int32, which is the API version.
+
+    org.x.config.input.add:
+        Takes an argument of key/value option pairs in arrays, e.g.:
+         [ss][ss][ss][ss]
+        is the signature for four options.  These options will be passed
+        to the input driver as with any others.
+        Option names beginning with _ are not allowed; they are reserved
+        for internal use.
+
+        Returns a number of signed int32s.  Positive integers are the
+        device IDs of new devices; negative numbers are X error codes,
+        as defined in X.h.  BadMatch will be returned if the options
+        given do not match any device.  BadValue is returned for a malformed
+        message.  (Example: 8 is new device ID 8; -8 is BadMatch.)
+
+        Notably, BadAlloc is never returned: the server internally signals
+        to D-BUS that the attempt failed for lack of memory.
+
+    org.x.config.input.remove:
+        Takes one uint32 argument, which is the device ID to remove, i.e.:
+         u
+        is the signature.
+
+        Returns one signed int32 which represents an X status as defined in
+        X.h. See org.x.config.input.add. Error codes are negative numbers.
+
+    org.x.config.input.listDevices:
+        Lists the currently active devices. No argument. 
+        Return value is sequence of [<id> <name>] [<id> <name>] ..., i.e. [us].

+------------------------------------------------------
+Quick Guide To Patching This Package For The Impatient
+------------------------------------------------------
+
+1. Make sure you have quilt installed
+2. Unpack the package as usual with "dpkg-source -x"
+3. Run the "patch" target in debian/rules
+4. Create a new patch with "quilt new" (see quilt(1))
+5. Edit all the files you want to include in the patch with "quilt edit"
+   (see quilt(1)).
+6. Write the patch with "quilt refresh" (see quilt(1))
+7. Run the "clean" target in debian/rules
+
+Alternatively, instead of using quilt directly, you can drop the patch in to
+debian/patches and add the name of the patch to debian/patches/series.
+
+------------------------------------
+Guide To The X Strike Force Packages
+------------------------------------
+
+The X Strike Force team maintains X packages in git repositories on
+git.debian.org in the pkg-xorg subdirectory. Most upstream packages
+are actually maintained in git repositories as well, so they often
+just need to be pulled into git.debian.org in a "upstream-*" branch.
+Otherwise, the upstream sources are manually installed in the Debian
+git repository.
+
+The .orig.tar.gz upstream source file could be generated using this
+"upstream-*" branch in the Debian git repository but it is actually
+copied from upstream tarballs directly.
+
+Due to X.org being highly modular, packaging all X.org applications
+as their own independent packages would have created too many Debian
+packages. For this reason, some X.org applications have been grouped
+into larger packages: xutils, xutils-dev, x11-apps, x11-session-utils,
+x11-utils, x11-xfs-utils, x11-xkb-utils, x11-xserver-utils.
+Most packages, including the X.org server itself and all libraries
+and drivers are, however maintained independently.
+
+The Debian packaging is added by creating the "debian-*" git branch
+which contains the aforementioned "upstream-*" branch plus the debian/
+repository files.
+When a patch has to be applied to the Debian package, two solutions
+are involved:
+* If the patch is available in one of the upstream branches, it
+  may be git'cherry-picked into the Debian repository. In this
+  case, it appears directly in the .diff.gz.
+* Otherwise, the patch is added to debian/patches/ which is managed
+  with quilt as documented in /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.
+
+----------------------------------------------
+Updating xorg-server to a new upstream release
+----------------------------------------------
+
+* The abibumpcheck target helps us notice any ABI bump:
+  - A major ABI bump means drivers have to be rebuilt.
+  - A minor ABI bump means the version in serverminver has to be
+    bumped.
+  Reference documentation about dependencies is available at:
+    http://pkg-xorg.alioth.debian.org/reference/dependencies.html
+* We have to keep track of the SDK_REQUIRED_MODULES variable in
+  configure.ac. It is used to determine xorg-server.pc's dependencies
+  so xserver-xorg-dev's dependencies have to be adjusted when this
+  variable changes. This variable is set to a list of modules, but is
+  updated a few times. It's probably a good idea to use:
+    git grep SDK_REQUIRED_MODULES= -- configure.ac

+ This is not quite the same as the DDK (Driver Development Kit) from the
+ XFree86 4.x and X.Org 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 series of servers; it provides
+ headers and a pkg-config file for drivers using autotools to build
+ against.
+ .
+ Unless you are developing or building a driver, you probably want
+ xserver-xorg and/or xserver-xorg-core instead.

+Description: distributed multihead X server
+ Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
+ display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
+ might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
+ that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
+ rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
+ front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
+ configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
+ line), the clients see a single large screen.

+Provides: xserver
+Description: Nested X server
+ Xnest is a nested X server that simply relays all its requests to another
+ X server, where it runs as a client.  This means that it appears as another
+ window in your current X session.  Xnest relies upon its parent X server
+ for font services.
+ .
+ Use of the Xephyr X server instead of Xnest is recommended.

+Multi-Arch: foreign
+Description: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
+ Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
+ and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
+ memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
+ but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
+ against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
+ Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
+ X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
+ applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
+ anyway.
+ .
+ This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
+ simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
+ environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
+ program.

+Description: nested X server

+ X server codebase (e.g. VNC servers) to (re-)use officially

+.SH NAME
+xvfb\-run \- run specified X client or command in a virtual X server environment
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B xvfb\-run
+[
+.I options
+]
+.I command
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B xvfb\-run
+is a wrapper for the
+.BR Xvfb (1x)
+command which simplifies the task of running commands (typically an X
+client, or a script containing a list of clients to be run) within a virtual
+X server environment.
+.PP
+.B xvfb\-run
+sets up an X authority file (or uses an existing user\-specified one),
+writes a cookie to it (see
+.BR xauth (1x))
+and then starts the
+.B Xvfb
+X server as a background process.
+The process ID of
+.B Xvfb
+is stored for later use.
+The specified
+.I command
+is then run using the X display corresponding to the
+.B Xvfb
+server
+just started and the X authority file created earlier.
+.PP
+When the
+.I command
+exits, its status is saved, the
+.B Xvfb
+server is killed (using the process ID stored earlier), the X authority
+cookie removed, and the authority file deleted (if the user did not specify
+one to use).
+.B xvfb\-run
+then exits with the exit status of
+.IR command .
+.PP
+.B xvfb\-run
+requires the
+.B xauth
+command to function.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B \-a\fR,\fB \-\-auto\-servernum
+Try to get a free server number, starting at 99, or the argument to
+.BR \-\-server\-num .
+.TP
+.BI \-e\  file \fR,\fB\ \-\-error\-file= file
+Store output from
+.B xauth
+and
+.B Xvfb
+in
+.IR file .
+The default is
+.IR /dev/null .
+.TP
+.BI \-f\  file \fR,\fB\ \-\-auth\-file= file
+Store X authentication data in
+.IR file .
+By default, a temporary directory called
+.IR xvfb\-run. PID
+(where PID is the process ID of
+.B xvfb\-run
+itself) is created in the directory specified by the environment variable
+.B TMPDIR
+(or
+.I /tmp
+if that variable is null or unset), and the
+.BR tempfile (1)
+command is used to create a file in that temporary directory called
+.IR Xauthority .
+.TP
+.B \-h\fR,\fB \-\-help
+Display a usage message and exit.
+.TP
+.BI \-n\  servernumber \fR,\fB\ \-\-server\-num= servernumber
+Use
+.I servernumber
+as the server number (but see the
+.B \-a\fR,\fB \-\-auto\-servernum
+option above).
+The default is 99.
+.TP
+.B \-l\fR,\fB \-\-listen\-tcp
+Enable TCP port listening in the X server.
+For security reasons (to avoid denial\-of\-service attacks or exploits),
+TCP port listening is disabled by default.
+.TP
+.BI \-p\  protocolname \fR,\fB\ \-\-xauth\-protocol= protocolname
+Use
+.I protocolname
+as the X authority protocol to use.
+The default is \(oq.\(cq, which
+.B xauth
+interprets as its own default protocol, which is MIT\-MAGIC\-COOKIE\-1.
+.TP
+.BI \-s\  arguments \fR,\fB\ \-\-server\-args= arguments
+Pass
+.I arguments
+to the
+.B Xvfb
+server.
+Be careful to quote any whitespace characters that may occur within
+.I arguments
+to prevent them from regarded as separators for
+.BR xvfb\-run 's
+own arguments.
+Also, note that specification of \(oq\-nolisten tcp\(cq in
+.I arguments
+may override the function of
+.BR xvfb\-run 's
+own
+.B \-l\fR,\fB \-\-listen\-tcp
+option, and that specification of the server number (e.g., \(oq:1\(cq) may
+be ignored because of the way the X server parses its argument list.
+Use the
+.B xvfb\-run
+option
+.BI \-n\  servernumber \fR,\fB\ \-\-server\-num= servernumber
+to achieve the latter function.
+The default is \(oq\-screen 0 640x480x8\(cq.
+.TP
+.BI \-w\  delay \fR,\fB\ \-\-wait= delay
+Ignored for compatibility with earlier versions.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+.TP
+.B COLUMNS
+indicates the width of the terminal device in character cells.
+This value is used for formatting diagnostic messages.
+If not set, the terminal is queried using
+.BR stty (1)
+to determine its width.
+If that fails, a value of \(oq80\(cq is assumed.
+.TP
+.B TMPDIR
+specifies the directory in which to place
+.BR xvfb\-run 's
+temporary directory for storage of the X authority file; only used if the
+.B \-f
+or
+.B \-\-auth\-file
+options are not specified.
+.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
+.PP
+Unless the
+.B \-f
+or
+.B \-\-auth\-file
+options are specified, a temporary
+directory and file within it are created (and deleted) to store the X
+authority cookies used by the
+.B Xvfb
+server and client(s) run under it.
+See
+.BR tempfile (1).
+If \-f or \-\-auth\-file are used, then the specified X authority file is
+only written to, not created or deleted (though
+.B xauth
+creates an authority file itself if told to use use that does not already
+exist).
+.PP
+An error file with a user\-specified name is also created if the
+.B \-e
+or
+.B \-\-error\-file
+options are specifed; see above.
+.SH "EXIT STATUS"
+.B xvfb\-run
+uses its exit status as well as output to standard error to communicate
+diagnostics.
+The exit status of \(oq1\(cq is not used, and should be interpreted as failure
+of the specified command.
+.TP
+0
+.B xvfb\-run
+only uses this exit status if the
+.B \-h\fR,\fB \-\-help
+option is given.
+In all other situations, this may be interpreted as success of the specified
+command.
+.TP
+2
+No command to run was specified.
+.TP
+3
+The
+.B xauth
+command is not available.
+.TP
+4
+The temporary directory that was going to be used already exists; since
+.B xvfb\-run
+produces a uniquely named directory, this may indicate an attempt by another
+process on the system to exploit a temporary file race condition.
+.TP
+5
+A problem was encountered while cleaning up the temporary directory.
+.TP
+6
+A problem was encountered while using
+.BR getopt (1)
+to parse the command\-line arguments.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP
+.B xvfb\-run \-\-auto\-servernum \-\-server\-num=1 xlogo
+runs the
+.BR xlogo (1x)
+demonstration client inside the
+.B Xvfb
+X server on the first available server number greater than or equal to 1.
+.TP
+.B xvfb\-run \-\-server\-args="\-screen 0 1024x768x24" ico \-faces
+runs the
+.BR ico (1x)
+demonstration client (and passes it the
+.B \-faces
+argument) inside the
+.B Xvfb
+X server, configured with a root window of 1024 by 768 pixels and a color
+depth of 24 bits.
+.PP
+Note that the demo X clients used in the above examples will not exit on
+their own, so they will have to be killed before
+.B xvfb\-run
+will exit.

+See
+.URL "https://bugs.debian.org/xvfb" "the Debian Bug Tracking System" .
+If you wish to report a bug in
+.BR xvfb\-run ,
+please use the 
+.BR reportbug (1)

+xorg-server (2:1.17.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium
+
+  The Xorg server is no longer setuid root by default.  This change reduces the
+  risk of privilege escalation due to X server bugs, but has some side effects:
+
+  * it relies on logind and libpam-systemd
+  * it relies on a kernel video driver (so the userspace component doesn't
+    touch the hardware directly)
+  * it needs X to run on the virtual console (VT) it was started from
+  * it changes the location for storing the Xorg log from /var/log/ to
+    ~/.local/share/xorg/
+
+  On systems where those are not available, the new xserver-xorg-legacy package
+  is needed to allow X to run with elevated privileges.  See the
+  Xwrapper.config(5) manual page for configuration details.

+First of all: C89 or better.  If you don't have that, port gcc first.
+
+Use of C language extensions throughout the X server tree
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+Optional extensions:
+The server will still build if your toolchain does not support these
+extensions, although the results may not be optimal.
+
+    * _X_SENTINEL(x): member x of the passed structure must be NULL, e.g.:
+                      void parseOptions(Option *options _X_SENTINEL(0));
+                      parseOptions("foo", "bar", NULL); /* this is OK */
+                      parseOptions("foo", "bar", "baz"); /* this is not */
+                      This definition comes from Xfuncproto.h in the core
+                      protocol headers.
+    * _X_ATTRIBUTE_PRINTF(x, y): This function has printf-like semantics;
+                                 check the format string when built with
+                                 -Wformat (gcc) or similar.
+    * _X_EXPORT: this function should appear in symbol tables.
+    * _X_HIDDEN: this function should not appear in the _dynamic_ symbol
+                 table.
+    * _X_INTERNAL: like _X_HIDDEN, but attempt to ensure that this function
+                   is never called from another module.
+    * _X_INLINE: inline this function if possible (generally obeyed unless
+                 disabling optimisations).
+    * _X_DEPRECATED: warn on use of this function.
+
+Mandatory extensions:
+The server will not build if your toolchain does not support these extensions.
+
+    * named initialisers: explicitly initialising structure members, e.g.:
+                          struct foo bar = { .baz = quux, .brian = "dog" };
+    * variadic macros: macros with a variable number of arguments, e.g.:
+                       #define DebugF(x, ...) /**/
+    * interleaved code and declarations: { foo = TRUE; int bar; do_stuff(); }
+
+
+Use of library facilities throughout the X server tree
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Non-OS-dependent code can assume facilities at least as good as
+the non-OS-facility parts of POSIX-1.2001.  Ideally this would
+be C99, but even gcc+glibc doesn't implement that yet.
+
+Unix-like systems are assumed to be at least as good as UNIX03.
+
+Note that there are two Windows ports, Cygwin and MinGW:
+- Cygwin is more or less like Linux.
+- MinGW is more restrictive. Windows does not provide the required
+POSIX facilities, so some non-OS-dependent code is stubbed out or
+has an alternate implementation if WIN32 is defined.  Code that
+needs to be portable to Windows should be careful to, well, be portable.
+
+
+Required OS facilities
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Linux systems must be at least 2.4 or later.  As a practical matter
+though, 2.4 kernels never receive any testing.  Use 2.6 already.
+
+TODO: Solaris.
+
+TODO: *BSD.
+
+Windows-dependent code assumes at least NT 5.1.
+
+OSX support is generally limited to the most recent version.  Currently
+that means 10.5.

+                        XKM File Format Description
+                                Version 15
+
+1. Introduction
+
+The XKM file format is the exchange format for XKB keyboard descriptions
+between the server and xkbcomp. Usually, the server forks off xkbcomp,
+xkbcomp compiles the XKM format from the given parameters.
+The resulting XKM file is put into a directory readable by the server and
+then parsed.
+
+The XKM format is little more than a binary dump of various XKB-specific
+structures and hence tied to the ABI of the server.
+
+                              ❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧
+
+1.1 About this file format description
+
+This description was produced by analyzing the XKM parsing code. Parts of
+the file description present in the original format specification may be
+missing. This description thus cannot be a reference document for XKM
+implementations.
+
+No description of the meaning of the various fields is given here. Refer to
+the XKB protocol specification for more details.
+                              ❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧
+
+2. Notations used in this document
+
+Notation for structures:
+
+┌───
+  Name of struct
+	name of field:		type or fixed value of field
+	name of field:		type or fixed value of field
+└───
+
+Data types are identical to those used in the X Protocol specification
+except where noted otherwise. Structs specific to XKM are prefixed with XKM,
+defines specific to the XKB protocol specification are prefixed with Xkb and
+their value is equivalent to that in the protocol specification.
+
+Multiple instances of a given type are denoted in the following form:
+	name of field:		LISTofFIELDTYPE
+
+Length specifiers for such fields are usually prefixed with num_. For
+example, a struct containing a num_foo of 8 and a 'foo' field contains 8
+structures of type 'foo'.
+
+Variable length padding is specified as pad(x), where x is the length of the
+data to be padded out to a multiple of 4 bytes. For example, given an x of
+10, pad(x) would be the remaining 2 bytes to pad the whole struct to 12
+bytes.
+
+A special notation is a variable content struct. In this case, the contents
+of the struct depend on the value of one or more specific fields.
+┌───
+  Name of struct
+	field:			type or fixed value of field
+	field:			type or fixed value of field
+	───
+	field ⇒ value 1
+	⇒
+		specific field:		type
+		specific field:		type
+	───
+        field ⇒ value 2
+	⇒
+		specific field:		type
+		specific field:		type
+└───
+This notation denotes that if field is of value 1, this struct contains the
+specific fields listed underneath value 1.
+
+                              ❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧
+
+3. XKM Format
+
+The XKM format is a binary format with structs usually being padded to a
+multiple of 4 bytes. No provisions for endianess are provided, the parser is
+left to guess the endianess of the XKM file.
+
+                              ❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧
+3.1 Common data types
+
+┌───
+  XKMCountedString
+	count:			CARD16
+	string:			count * CHAR
+	pad:			pad(count + 2)
+└───
+
+XKMCountedString is used for user-readable identifiers. Prime example are
+the level names and the section names ("complete", "evdev(inet)", etc.)
+
+┌───
+  XKMGroupBits:		CARD8
+	group1			0x1
+	group2			0x2
+	group3			0x4
+	group4			0x8
+└───
+
+                              ❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧
+
+3.2 Header and Table of Contents
+
+┌───
+  XKMHeader
+	version:		CARD8
+	identifier1:		'm'
+	identifier2:		'k'
+	idenfifier3:		'x'
+└───
+
+The XKM file format has a 4 byte header identifying the file and the XKM
+version. The header is followed by the table of contents indicating the
+sections present in this file.
+
+┌───
+  XKMFileInfo
+	type:			CARD8
+	min_keycode:		CARD8
+	max_keycode:		CARD8
+	num_sectioninfo:	CARD8
+	present:		CARD16
+	pad:			CARD16
+	sectioninfo:		LISTofXKMSectionInfo
+└───
+
+min_keycode and max_keycode specify the keycode range for this keyboard
+descriptions. The core protocol requires min_keycode always be equal to or
+greater than 8.
+
+┌───
+  XKMSectionInfo
+	type:			CARD16
+		XkmTypesIndex		0
+		XkmCompatMapIndex	1
+		XkmSymbolsIndex		2
+		XkmIndicatorsIndex	3
+		XkmKeyNamesIndex	4
+		XkmGeometryIndex	5
+		XkmVirtualModsIndex	6
+	format:			CARD16
+	size:			CARD16
+	offset:			CARD16
+└───
+
+Describes the section found in a chunk of a file. This struct is found
+_twice_ in the file per section, once as part of the XKMFileInfo, once at
+the beginning of the actual section (see offset).
+The type specifies the type of the section, the section is to be parsed
+according to this type.
+Size and offset specify the size in bytes and the offset into the file in
+bytes, respectively.
+
+3.3 Sections
+
+Each section resides at the offset specified in the XKMFileInfo sectioninfo.
+
+                              ❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧❧
+
+3.3.1 XKMTypes
+
+An XKMTypes section describes the key types defined in a layout. Roughly
+speaking, a key type defines how many levels a given key has and which
+modifiers change to a particular level.
+
+┌───
+  XKMTypesSection
+	section_info:		XKMSectionInfo
+	name:			XKMCountedString
+	num_types:		CARD16
